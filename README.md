# Suspicious-activity-detection


This project involves the development of a machine learning model to detect suspicious activities from video data. Using the UCF Crime dataset, the project aims to classify and identify various types of suspicious behaviors captured in surveillance videos. This notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of the detection system.

Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and preprocessed for model training.
Model Training: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep learning techniques to train a robust model for activity detection.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
Visualization: Provides visualizations of the results to better understand the model's performance.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the UCF Crime dataset, which includes various types of criminal activities captured in real-world scenarios.
